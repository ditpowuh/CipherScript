# CipherScript

#### CipherScript is a javascript extension which adds more readable data and more shortcuts to do certain things. CipherScript is hackable/editable and can be modified in many ways (when you are using it for HTML).
#### CipherScript is very small (in size); the size of CipherScript is less than 1 MB. It is not recommended to edit/change/hack the file 'setup.js' unless you know what you are doing.
#### It is recommended that you have some experience with JavaScript when you use CipherScript. If you do not have any experience, you should definitely learn about JavaScript first.

### Regular (Link JS File To HTML File)
#### The following files will be found in the folder: 'Regular'.

#### How to install/add:
```
To install or add CipherScript, you need the most important file: 'setup.js'
'setup.js' will set up CipherScript. To link CipherScript to your HTML files, please take a look at
'example.html' for an example.
```
#### File(s): setup.js
```
'setup.js' is the setup process for CipherScript. It is the most important file to install out of all of them.
For more information, check 'How to install/add:'.
```
#### File(s): console.html + console.js + default.css
```
'console.html' is the console for CipherScript. Open it (without a text editor) and it will open up a page.
That page is the console. 'console.js' is the script for the console.
'default.css' is unnecessary and is just decoration for the console.
```
#### File(s): #Testing [Folder]
```
The '#Testing' folder contains my testing for certain things.
'#Testing' is unnecessary; you do not have to download it.
```
#### File(s): Other Files
```
Some other files that are within this repository are unnecessary and are not required to be download,
however, it may change your performance and quality. So, it is recommended that you download ALL files.
```
#### Summary
```
Here is a summary of what is above. 'console.html' + 'console.js' + 'default.css' is the console
for CipherScript and to install CipherScript, download 'setup.js', then, link 'setup.js' with a HTML
file (See 'example.html' for an example). '#Testing' is a folder which contains my testing.
