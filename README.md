# CipherScript

#### CipherScript is a javascript extension which adds more readable data and more shortcuts to do certain things. CipherScript is hackable/editable and can be modified in many ways.
#### CipherScript is very small (In size); the size of CipherScript is less than 1 MB. It is unrecommended to edit/change/hack the file 'setup.js' unless you know what you are doing.

#### How to install/add:
```
To install or add CipherScript, you need the most important file: 'setup.js'
'setup.js' will set up CipherScript. To link CipherScript to your HTML files, please take a look at
'example.html' for an example.
```
#### File(s): setup.js
```
'setup.js' is the setup process for CipherScript. It is the most important file to install out of all of them.
For more information, check 'How to install/add:'.
```
#### File(s): console.html + console.js + default.css
```
'console.html' is the console for CipherScript. Open it (without a text editor) and it will open up a page.
That page is the console. 'console.js' is the script for the console.
'default.css' is unnecessary and is just decoration for the console.
```
#### File(s): #Testing [Folder]
```
The '#Testing' folder contains my testing for certain things. 
'#Testing' is unnecessary; you do not have to download it. 
```
#### File(s): Other Files
```
Other files that are within this repository are unnecessary and are not required to be downloaded.
```
#### Summary
```
Here is a summary of what is above. 'console.html' + 'console.js' + 'default.css' is the console
for CipherScript and to install CipherScript, download 'setup.js', then, link 'setup.js' with a HTML
file (See 'example.html' for an example).
